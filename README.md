## INTRODUCTION
This project presents students with the task of designing an intelligent autonomous vehicle with two wheels, utilising the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The vehicle is equipped with a range of sensors and incorporates a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The main objective of this project is to design and construct an autonomous robotic car capable of efficiently navigating a predetermined course while effectively avoiding obstacles and accurately identifying barcodes through the utilisation of infrared sensors. The incorporation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller improves the control system of the automobile, guaranteeing seamless and precise movement while navigating and scanning barcodes.
